# MBHC_WMM
Implementation of the clustering method: Model Based Hierarchical Clustering using Watson Mixture Model (MBHC-WMM)

- The MBHC-WMM method is an automatic method to cluster 3 dimensional axial data. This repo provides GUI demo with MATLAB code to do the following tasks: <br>
**a.** load 3 dimensional axial (labeled/unlabeled) data and display them. <br>
**b.** Generate/Synthesize 3 dimensional axial (labeled/unlabeled) data with given number of groups/cluster. <br>
**c.** Automatically cluster 3 dimensional axial data.  <br>

This clustering method has been used to cluster image normals (3D directional unit vectors) for analyzing depth/3D images. For details please see the reference.
